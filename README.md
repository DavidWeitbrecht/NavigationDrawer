# NavigationDrawer
Navigation drawer open in all views
I struggled to find a solution to having a Navigation drawer open in all activities.

I implemented the code in this stack overflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19451715/same-navigation-drawer-in-different-activities

The stack overflow answer wasn't a complete solution so I uploaded this so beginners can see the example from beginning to end.


Overview:
Create a base class which contains all the navigation drawer code etc (this code was auto generated by clicking "add new activity"->"Navigation drawer"

Created a Frame Layout in the layout "app_bar_base.xml" 
This frame layout will contain all new activity layouts/info etc

Created two new activities "Home" and "Gallery"
Extended these classes to "Base Activity"
Added a text view in each to identify the activity
Instead of setContentView a layout inflator was used:
        FrameLayout contentFrameLayout = (FrameLayout) findViewById(R.id.content_frame);
        //Remember this is the FrameLayout area within your activity_main.xml
        getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.activity_gallery, contentFrameLayout);
